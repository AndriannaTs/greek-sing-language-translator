This project aims to build a sensors-glove system, which will translate the corresponding movement of the hand into letters of the Greek Sign Language and then will appear in the Bluetooth application of the mobile. 
It aims to help users of the Greek Sign Language to communicate with non-users. The focus of this work is the design and implementation of a lowcost glove using open source, hardware and software in the microcontroller, for the interpretation of basic gestures.
The programming of this glove is exsecuted by the use of Arduino program so that it can accept the commands that will be given to it so that the desired actions can be seen.
The results are sent wirelessly to a Bluetooth enabled smartphone
for on-screen display. This shows us that the basic gestures can be interpreted accurately using a simple algorithm.
